# Newton's Laws of Motion

## Overview
Sir Isaac Newton formulated three fundamental laws that describe the relationship between forces acting on a body and its motion.

## First Law (Law of Inertia)
**Statement**: An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

**Key Points:**
- Objects resist changes in their state of motion
- Also known as the Law of Inertia
- Inertia depends on mass - more massive objects have more inertia

**Examples:**
- A book on a table remains at rest until pushed
- A hockey puck sliding on ice continues moving until friction stops it
- Passengers lurch forward when a car brakes suddenly

## Second Law (F = ma)
**Statement**: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
F = ma
where:
F = Force (Newtons)
m = mass (kg)  
a = acceleration (m/sÂ²)
```

**Key Points:**
- Force and acceleration are in the same direction
- Larger forces produce larger accelerations
- More massive objects require more force to achieve the same acceleration

**Examples:**
- Pushing a shopping cart - more force makes it accelerate faster
- A heavy truck needs more force than a car to accelerate at the same rate

## Third Law (Action-Reaction)
**Statement**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Key Points:**
- Forces always occur in pairs
- Action and reaction forces act on different objects
- The forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction

**Examples:**
- Walking: You push back on the ground, ground pushes forward on you
- Rocket propulsion: Hot gases pushed down, rocket pushed up
- Swimming: Push water backward, water pushes you forward

## Applications
- **Engineering**: Designing vehicles, bridges, and machines
- **Sports**: Understanding ball trajectories and athlete movements  
- **Space Exploration**: Calculating rocket trajectories and orbital mechanics
- **Transportation**: Vehicle safety systems and traffic flow analysis
