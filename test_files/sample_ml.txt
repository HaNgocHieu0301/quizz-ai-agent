Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Key Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Finds patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Association Rules
   - Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through trial and error
   - Uses rewards and penalties
   - Applications: Game playing, Robotics

Popular Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values
- Decision Trees: Creates tree-like model of decisions
- Neural Networks: Mimics human brain structure
- Support Vector Machines: Finds optimal decision boundaries
- Random Forest: Combines multiple decision trees

Real-world Applications:
- Image Recognition: Identifying objects in photos
- Natural Language Processing: Understanding human language
- Recommendation Systems: Suggesting products or content
- Fraud Detection: Identifying suspicious transactions
- Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars

Machine Learning Process:
1. Data Collection: Gather relevant data
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data
3. Model Selection: Choose appropriate algorithm
4. Training: Teach the model using training data
5. Evaluation: Test model performance
6. Deployment: Use model in production

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: Data used to teach the model
- Test Data: Data used to evaluate model performance
- Features: Input variables used for prediction
- Labels: Output variables (in supervised learning)
- Overfitting: Model performs well on training but poorly on new data
- Cross-validation: Technique to assess model generalization
